# CENG403 - Deep Learning Take-Home Assignment 2

This repository contains my solution for Take-Home Exam 2 (THE2) in the CENG403 Deep Learning course at METU. The assignment focuses on CNN architecture design, regularization, and training strategies.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Model training using PyTorch
- Dropout regularization
- Data augmentation techniques (e.g., random crop, horizontal flip)
- Evaluation using training and validation accuracy/loss plots
- Early stopping and performance monitoring

## 📁 File

- `CEng403_THE2.ipynb`: The complete Jupyter notebook with explanations, code, plots, and performance summaries.

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- Trained multiple CNN models on a given image dataset
- Compared training curves under different regularization settings
- Analyzed overfitting and generalization through visualization

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
